    <h2>Common elements</h2>
    <p>The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two classes of football: carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, Austrralian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hnds or thrown, and kicking codes such as Association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved pri,arily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.<sup>[11]</sup></p>
    <p>Common rules among the sports include:<sup >[12]</sup></p>
    <ul>

        <li><a href="#">Scoring goals</a> or points by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line.</li>
